# Text Decipherer Project Summary!
This project is a C++-based search engine that processes web pages, constructs an inverted index, and allows users to perform complex search queries using Boolean logic. The program reads files containing web pages (with URLs and body text), cleans the content by removing punctuation and irrelevant characters, and builds an inverted index that maps each word to the pages where it appears. Users can search for terms using basic queries or Boolean operators such as + (AND) and - (NOT), which allow for more refined searches like finding pages that contain a certain word but exclude another. The engine efficiently handles queries by leveraging C++ standard library data structures like maps and sets. In addition to basic functionality, it also manages edge cases such as missing files, empty queries, and punctuation in search terms. Comprehensive unit tests using GoogleTest are also included to ensure consistancy and correctness across various test cases.
